This is a remake of Night Lights for Fabric 1.21.1. This mod adds a variety of different toggleable light blocks!

I looked and looked for a mod that would add fairy lights in fabric 1.21.1 and was only met with disappointment. However, I did find a mod just one major version behind, and I thought to myself "How hard could it really be to update a mod?". So anyway, I programmed the entire thing from scratch.
